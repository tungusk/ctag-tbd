# dadamachines TBD-16

The first standalone desktop audio DSP platform based on [CTAG TBD](https://github.com/ctag-fh-kiel/ctag-tbd), with standard MIDI connectivity — designed to bring open-source audio processing beyond Eurorack.

**TBD-16** combines 50+ high-quality generators and effects in a modular, extensible architecture. It is built for musicians, educators, and audio researchers who want hands-on DSP without proprietary lock-in.

## Documentation

**[dadamachines.github.io/ctag-tbd](https://dadamachines.github.io/ctag-tbd/)** — setup guides, plugin reference, flashing.

## Build your own plugin or machine

TBD-16 is open to community contributions. Every sound on the device — synths, drum voices, effects, the 16-track **GrooveBoxRack** and its machine voices — is a C++ plugin against a small DSP API. There are two flavours:

- **Legacy `ctagSoundProcessor` plugin** — a standalone, Eurorack-style sound processor (one synth or effect per slot).
- **GrooveBoxRack machine** — a drum or synth voice that lives inside the 16-track rack, with macros, presets, and the integrated sequencer.

You can iterate without flashing the device — a **desktop simulator** runs the same plugin code on your laptop with a web UI in the browser.

### Get started in 4 links

- **[Plugin documentation](https://dadamachines.github.io/ctag-tbd/plugins/)** — API reference, parameter / macro / preset model, GrooveBoxRack machine guide, examples
- **[`generators/`](generators/readme.md)** — Node.js scaffolding for new plugins (`generator.js`) and new rack machines (`rackgen.js`); one command to drop a working stub in place
- **[`simulator/`](simulator/readme.md)** — host-side build of the firmware + a browser WebUI; develop and audition plugins without the device
- **[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md)** — branch model, CI / CDN pipeline, PR workflow, CLA

PRs go against the [`dada-tbd-master`](https://github.com/dadamachines/ctag-tbd/tree/dada-tbd-master) branch; CI builds and validates every PR automatically. If your PR adds something generally useful for the upstream CTAG TBD engine, we'll happily help open a parallel PR there.

## What this fork does

This repository is a fork of [ctag-fh-kiel/ctag-tbd](https://github.com/ctag-fh-kiel/ctag-tbd) (branch `p4_main`), adapted for the **dadamachines TBD-16** hardware. Our focus:

- **UI/UX** — Redesigned web interface with musician-friendly interaction patterns
- **Documentation** — Clear guides, example workflows, and UX guidelines for plugin developers
- **Desktop hardware** — Standalone form factor with standard MIDI, no Eurorack required
- **Macro / preset / rack layer** — The 16-track GrooveBoxRack on top of the CTAG plugin model

The DSP engine and plugin system come from upstream, originally created by [Robert Manzke](https://github.com/ctag-fh-kiel/ctag-tbd); dadamachines and Per-Olov Jernberg add the macro / preset / rack layer, the WebUI, the docs site, hardware-specific drivers, and the GrooveBoxRack machine framework.

## Project structure

### Building the documentation locally

```bash
pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
sphinx-build -b html -c docs/config docs build/docs
# open build/docs/index.html
```

## Community & support

- [dadamachines Forum](https://forum.dadamachines.com) — Ask questions, share patches, connect with other TBD users and developers.
- [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/dadamachines/ctag-tbd/issues) — Bug reports and feature requests.

## Hardware

TBD-16 ships with the full hardware platform (ESP32-P4 + RP2350 coprocessor for sequencer / OLED / MIDI + SD card). The firmware also supports three lighter board variants. See [HARDWARE_CONFIGURATIONS.md](HARDWARE_CONFIGURATIONS.md) for the feature matrix and the Kconfig flags that select between them.

## Credits

The **dadamachines CTAG TBD adaptation** is led by Johannes Elias Lohbihler. **CTAG TBD** was originally created by Robert Manzke.
